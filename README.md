FuelEconomyCalculator

Fuel economy calculator designed to help people work out their fuel economy in MPG, L/100km or KPL based upon fuel pumped amount in either litres or gallons and distance travelled in miles of km. Unlike online calculators, this program will create a history file for all calculations done. This program was created mainly to learn and practise coding in C#.


To use this program, you must first fill your car's fuel tank to the brim, then zero your trip counter. Then drive for a week and then refuel, making a note of the litres or gallons it took to refill the tank. Then after taking a note of the miles or km on the trip counter an zeroing the trip put the two sets of numbers into the calculator for the unit of measurement chosen.

Each calculator has the units of measurement used for the calculation next to it's menu option on the main menu.

In the main menu, it will show the units of measurements expected next to each calculator option.
